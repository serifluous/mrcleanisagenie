	<p>Q: Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Clean a sailor?</p>
	<p>A: That was a lie perpetuated by the Eisenhower Administration after the discovery of a real genie in Guatemala in the mid-1950s. The public couldn&rsquo;t stand to know that real genies floated among us, so they came up with the Mr. Clean character to dispute the idea in the American psyche.</p>

	<p>Q: Sailors wear earrings too, don&rsquo;t they?</p>
	<p>A: Up until 1954, Sailors didn&rsquo;t wear earrings. The Korean war had brought American sailors to Asia, witnessing the use of Genies in combat. Those sailors that fought against genies wear the earring now as a sign of remembrance for those lost in combat against genie magic.</p>

	<p>Q: Why is a genie being used to sell cleaning products?</p>
	<p>A: In an effort to discredit the strength of genie magic, the Mr. Clean character was created as propaganda to feminize and undermine genies, leading the public to believe that those who are genie-like in appearance are limited in their use of power to household chores.</p>
